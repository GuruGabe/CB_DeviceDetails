# CB_DeviceDetails
Like [CB_QueryDetails](https://github.com/NoSubstitute/CB_QueryDetails) but updated with Deprovision and some Swedish text.

Make sure you edit line 17 in [deprovions.gs](https://github.com/NoSubstitute/CB_DeviceDetails/blob/main/deprovisionDevice.gs) to point to the OU where you keep your deprovisioned devices.

Yes, you should keep them separate from your active devices. :-)

Oh, yes, I should totally make that a variable instead. :-)
